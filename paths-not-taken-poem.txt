The Paths Not Taken

Two paths diverged in an experiment,
And sorry I could not travel both nor neither
And be one electron, I stood for a moment
And looked down each path which would not accept my movement
While I stood, taking a breather

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere moments and moments hence:
Two paths diverged in a lab, and Iâ€”
I cannot say how I traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
